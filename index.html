                <h2>What is "software?"</h2>
                <p>Think of software as instructions that tell your computer's hardware, its physical components, how to work. It comprises all programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of its system.</p>
                <h2>What is "software development?"</h2>
                <p>According to <a href='https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=5227' target='_blank'>IBM Research</a>: "Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software."</p>
                <p>Software development comes into play when a team takes "raw" code, run it, test it, correct errors, and further develop it. If humans could create flawless, error-free systems, then there would be no need for software development. The fact is that software programs are written by mistake-making humans and not machines.</p>
                <h2>What do we learn in class?</h2>
                <p>In this course, we learn how to create interactive websites, either individually or collaboratively. There are three major languages we must learn: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML defines the content of webpages.</li>
                    <li>CSS specifies the layout of webpages.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript programs the behavior of webpages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>JavaScript allows the user to interact with the webpage in a variety of ways, like with the input boxes and logo at the top. With just a click you can change the <span id='changefont' title='Click Me'><u>font</u></span>, <span id='changecolor' title='Click Me'><u>color</u></span>, or <span id='changebg' title='Click Me'><u>backround</u></span> instantly.</p>
